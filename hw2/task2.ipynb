After I selected the restaurant, Siri focused strictly on the chosen entity and avoided mixing in nearby places. The results card was concise and actionable, so I could complete the task (find, call , navigate) with minimal friction. Siri’s multimodal feedback (spoken confirmation plus a clean on-screen card) also made the dialogue feel more controlled and reliable, even if it took one extra turn up front."
