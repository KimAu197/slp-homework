    "I First create plot without normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the normalized versions of the plots, I applied per-speaker z-score normalization to both pitch and intensity. The goal is to remove speaker-specific differences in overall pitch range and loudness, so that we can better compare how emotions affect relative changes within each speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, for each speaker we first extracted all frame-level pitch values (75–600 Hz, Praat autocorrelation) and all frame-level intensity values (minimum pitch 75 Hz, automatic time step) from all of their segments. I concatenated these arrays across all utterances of that speaker and computed a single global mean and standard deviation for pitch $(\\mu^{\\text{pitch}}_s, \\sigma^{\\text{pitch}}_s)$ and for intensity $(\\mu^{\\text{int}}_s, \\sigma^{\\text{int}}_s)$. Then, for every segment from speaker s, I normalized each frame x as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = \\frac{x - \\mu_s}{\\sigma_s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining the frame-level z-scores, we recomputed the min, max, and mean of pitch and intensity for each segment from the normalized sequences. These six z-scored features (min/max/mean pitch z, min/max/mean intensity z) are used in the “with normalization” plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose per-speaker z-score normalization because it explicitly controls for large inter-speaker variability in absolute pitch and intensity (e.g., naturally higher voices vs. lower voices), while preserving the within-speaker relative deviations that are more likely to be driven by emotion. This makes the emotion-level comparisons across the corpus more interpretable than using raw Hz/dB values."

    "From the 12 plots (raw and normalized features):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tHigh-arousal emotions systematically raise pitch, especially for panic.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the raw plots of min/max/mean pitch, panic consistently has the highest values, with elation, happy, and hot-anger also clearly above most other emotions. After per-speaker z-score normalization, these emotions still have positive or near-zero pitch z-scores, while low-arousal emotions remain negative. This suggests that even after controlling for each speaker’s baseline, high-arousal states are produced with systematically higher pitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tLow-arousal and negative emotions show lower pitch relative to each speaker’s baseline.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Emotions such as boredom, sadness, shame, and neutral tend to have lower min/max/mean pitch in the raw plots. In the normalized plots, their pitch z-scores are mostly negative, often among the lowest across all classes. I interpret this as evidence that speakers not only sound lower in absolute Hz, but also shift their pitch down relative to their own typical range when expressing these low-arousal or subdued emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tHigh-arousal emotions are also louder, especially in terms of maximum and mean intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the raw max and mean intensity plots, elation, happy, hot-anger, panic, and pride are clustered at the higher end of the dB scale, whereas boredom, sadness, and neutral tend to be softer. After normalization, these high-arousal emotions generally have positive intensity z-scores, while low-arousal emotions are closer to zero or negative. This pattern suggests a consistent coupling between emotional arousal and vocal loudness, not just pitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tPanic and elation show large variability across speakers, while neutral and boredom are more stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The error bars for panic and elation are relatively large in many of the pitch and intensity plots, both before and after normalization. I take this to mean that speakers use a wider range of acoustic strategies to express these emotions (some sounding extremely high-pitched or loud, others less so). In contrast, neutral and boredom usually have smaller error bars, which suggests that these states are expressed in a more consistent and constrained acoustic space.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tNormalization removes strong speaker effects but preserves the relative ordering of emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the raw pitch plots, the absolute differences between emotions are very large (on the order of 100–200 Hz), and these differences can easily be influenced by which speakers contribute more samples to a given emotion. After per-speaker z-score normalization, all emotions are centered around the zero baseline, and the dynamic range is compressed, but the ranking across emotions is largely preserved ( panic and elation still high, boredom and sadness still low). I learn from this that a substantial part of the raw variation is due to speaker-specific baselines, and that z-score normalization helps me focus on emotion-driven deviations from each speaker’s typical voice.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Normalization sharpens intensity-based differences that looked small in raw dB.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the raw max/mean intensity plots, most emotions cluster in a narrow range around ~70–80 dB, so the differences are not visually striking. After per-speaker z-score normalization, I see a much clearer separation: elation, happy, hot-anger, panic, and partly pride shift to positive intensity z-scores, while boredom, sadness, and neutral move to negative values. This tells me that absolute dB values are heavily influenced by microphone and speaker loudness, and normalization is crucial to reveal emotion-driven loudness patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Some emotions look strong in raw dB but are “normal” after normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, pride has relatively high raw max/mean intensity, but in the intensity z-score plots it is much closer to zero than elation or panic. This suggests that the speakers who produce pride already tend to speak loudly in general, so pride is not as strong a within-speaker loudness increase as elation or panic. Normalization helps me distinguish this emotion uses loud speakers from this emotion actually makes individual speakers louder than usual."

Macro-average F1 (0.338) is lower than the weighted F1 (0.3355), indicating that performance on minority or difficult classes is worse than on the more frequent/easier ones.

    "*\t**happy**: precision 0.452, recall 0.778, F1 0.571\n",
    "*\t**hot-anger**: 0.615 / 0.500 / 0.552\n",
    "*\t**contempt**: 0.417 / 0.526 / 0.465\n",
    "\n",
    "These emotions are often associated with strong, distinctive prosodic cues. For example, happy typically has higher mean pitch and intensity and a wider F0 range, while hot-anger tends to have high energy and sharp pitch excursions. Our feature set explicitly includes global pitch and intensity statistics from Parselmouth, as well as many energy- and F0-related descriptors from IS09. Thus, high-arousal or clearly marked emotional states are easier to separate in the acoustic-prosodic space. The high recall for happy suggests that, at least for this speaker, the classifier reliably detects strongly positive high-arousal speech.\n",

    "- **panic**: F1 ≈ 0.229  \n",
    "\n",
    "These classes are difficult for different reasons. Cold-anger has a prosodic profile closer to controlled or low-arousal negative emotions and likely overlaps with neutral, sadness, or mild anger; global statistics alone may not capture the subtle differences between these states. The neutral class shows an extreme precision–recall imbalance: the classifier almost never predicts “neutral”, but when it does, it is correct. This suggests that the model is overly conservative about assigning the neutral label and tends to map neutral utterances to nearby low-arousal emotions such as boredom or sadness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, interest and panic may share acoustic patterns with other high-arousal emotions (e.g., happy, elation, anxiety, hot-anger), making them hard to separate in the current feature space."

    "### Ideas for improving the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "This error pattern suggests several directions for future improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tIncorporate lexical features: Many distinctions that are hard to make acoustically (e.g., interest vs. happiness, cold-anger vs. neutral) may be clearer from the verbal content. Adding textual features from ASR transcripts ( TF–IDF, or sentence embeddings) could help disambiguate emotions that share similar prosody but differ in semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tModel temporal dynamics of prosody: Our current features are mostly global statistics over the whole utterance. Using sequence models on frame-level pitch and energy, or richer openSMILE functionals, may better capture the shape of prosodic contours.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tMore expressive acoustic representations. Replacing or augmenting IS09 with deep speech embeddings (e.g., wav2vec2 or Whisper encoder features) could capture more fine-grained spectral and voice-quality cues that help distinguish low-arousal and subtle negative states such as sadness and cold-anger. I did not explore this direction here, but maybe it is a promising avenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the best speaker-specific fold (speaker mm) shows that my current acoustic-prosodic feature set is particularly effective for clearly marked high-arousal emotions but struggles with subtle or low-arousal emotions. Combining lexical information and temporal modelingwould likely further improve performance on the most difficult classes."
